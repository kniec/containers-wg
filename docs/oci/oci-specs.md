These pages include an overview of specific OCI specs and projects, and comments about how the projects and specs
are or are not ideal for the HPC use case.  The core of OCI are the projects for container images, registry interactions (for the distribution of containers) and runtime interactions.  Use the left navigation to browse a particular spec or project.
