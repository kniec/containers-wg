## About Containers Working Group

The Containers Working group includes container enthusiasts that want to discuss the needs of the HPC community, and how
they can be integrated into existing or new Open Container Initiative (OCI) projects, or perhaps CNCF projects.
This documentation is based at the current [repository]({{ site.repo }}).

## About OCI

The Open Container Initiative was established in June 2015 by [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and other leaders in the containers industry to provide an intuitive API to interact with [linux containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(virtualization)).
Specs have largely been developed for a cloud native or industry use case, and this is largely because the HPC community has not had representation.
